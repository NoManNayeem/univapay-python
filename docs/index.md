# Univapay-Python SDK Docs

Welcome to the documentation for the (unofficial) Univapay-Python SDK.

What you can do with this SDK:

- Build frontend widget configs (one-time, subscription, recurring)
- Call server-side APIs for Charges, Subscriptions, Refunds, Cancels, Tokens
- Verify & parse webhooks (flexible header formats)
- Use handy utilities: currency conversion, idempotency keys, metadata sanitization

Get started:

- Quickstart: basic installation, config, and a simple charge
- Using with Python: common flows and patterns
- Using with Django & DRF: views/serializers and webhook integration
- Using with FastAPI: routers and dependency wiring
- API Reference: auto-generated docs from the SDK

Looking for the demo app? See the Flask demo in `examples/univapay_flask_demo/`.
